# Student-Spending-Analysis

### Project Overview
This project entails a detailed examination of the expenditure patterns among students, focusing on how they allocate their monthly income and utilize the financial aid provided within a specific educational institution.

### Data sources
The main dataset utilized for this analysis is the "student_spending" dataset sourced from the Kaggle website.

### Tools used
- Excel - Data Cleaning 
- Power Bi - Building Visuals


### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data-cleaning phase, I performed the following tasks;
- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning and formatting


### Expository Data Analysis(EDA)- Power Bi
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as;

-Analyzing total spending based on age, gender, and major
- Identifying the preferred payment method among students.
- Comparing the financial aid amount and monthly income to each student's total spending.

  



### Reviews/Findings

- The analysis revealed fluctuations in sales trends over time, with periods of growth and decline. Understanding these trends can help the store anticipate demand and adjust strategies accordingly.

- By examining sales and profit data by category and segment, the project identified the most profitable areas of the business. This insight can inform resource allocation and marketing efforts to maximize profitability.

- The identification of the top five most profitable products provides valuable information for inventory management and marketing strategies. Focusing on these high-performing products will drive sales and improve overall revenue.

### Recommendations

- Strategic Planning: Based on the findings, it is recommended that the store develop a strategic plan to capitalize on periods of growth and mitigate challenges during downturns. This could include adjusting inventory levels, launching targeted promotions, and optimizing pricing strategies.

- Category Optimization: Leveraging insights from the analysis, the store should consider allocating resources towards categories and segments with the highest profitability. Additionally, efforts should be made to identify and address underperforming categories to improve overall sales performance.

### Limitations

- The analysis focuses primarily on sales data and may not capture other factors that influence store performance, such as marketing campaigns, competitor actions, or economic conditions. Consideration of these external factors is essential for a holistic understanding of the store's performance.
