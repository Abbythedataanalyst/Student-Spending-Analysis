# Student-Spending-Analysis

### Project Overview
This project entails a detailed examination of the expenditure patterns among students, focusing on how they allocate their monthly income and utilize the financial aid provided within a specific educational institution.

### Data sources
The main dataset utilized for this analysis is the "student_spending" dataset sourced from the Kaggle website.

### Tools used
- Excel - Data Cleaning 
- Power Bi - Building Visuals


### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data-cleaning phase, I performed the following tasks;
- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning and formatting


### Expository Data Analysis(EDA)- Power Bi
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as;

- Analyzing total spending based on age, gender, and major
- Identifying the preferred payment method among students.
- Comparing the financial aid amount and monthly income to each student's total spending.

### Reviews/Findings
- The analysis revealed significant discrepancies between students' total spending and their monthly income combined with financial aid. Despite receiving financial assistance and having a monthly income, students appear to be spending more than they earn.

### Recommendation
- Implement budgeting workshops or financial literacy programs to educate students on responsible spending habits and effective money management techniques.
- Consider revising the financial aid distribution policy to ensure that students receive adequate support to cover essential expenses without resorting to overspending.

### Limitations
- External factors such as individual financial circumstances, personal preferences, and socioeconomic backgrounds may influence spending patterns, which the analysis cannot fully capture.
